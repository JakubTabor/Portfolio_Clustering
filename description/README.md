# Clustering:
* We can describe it as grouping similar informations
* Groups are created based of their common features

# First, we change the structure of my data to make it better self-descriptive
* Then I make simple outliers cleaning from outliers with help of graph plot
* Next I built correlation

# I take care of Categorical features with help of LabelEncoder and I drop features on deals
