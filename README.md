# Unsupervised learning is a domain of machine learning that focus on analyzing and cluster unlabeled data
* We use some models to discover hidden patterns and group data.
* Power of discover similarities and differences help us to np: customers profiling, image recognition and audience segmentation
* Our data, the informations need to be explored and made sense of it. To do it we use unsupervised machine learning.

# In this case I use clustering on marketing campaign data to find patterns in it and structure them
* I use PCA for dimensionality reduction and left only 3 the most important features
* I plot my dimensionality reduced data on 3D graph

# Next use elbow method to figure out optimal number of clusters
*

# And I use Agglomerative Clustering to create those clusters, then plot their distribution on 3D graph

#  Then I check distribution of my clusters and go into details into customers profiling
